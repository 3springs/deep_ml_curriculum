    "- LITHOLOGY_GEOLINK - This is the facies or lithology, which means rock type. This is a label, made by multiple human experts by looking at the context, the well, maps of the area, and often picture of rock samples extracted from the well.\n",
    "- [Well logs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_logging): These are specialised measurements by instruments lowered down the well hole\n",
    "    - CALI - [Caliper log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliper_log), this measures the size of the well bore\n",
    "    - GR - [Gamma Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray_logging): Measure passive amount of high energy electromagnetic radiation naturally emitted from the rock\n",
    "    - RHOB - [Bulk Density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_logging): Measured active amount high energy electromagnetic radiation. This has a transmitting source of gamma rays\n",
    "    - DTC - [Compressional wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_wave) travel time: This measure the how long a compressional wave takes to travel through the formationation\n",
    "    - RDEP - [Resistivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistivity_logging) Deep: Electrical resistivity through the rock with a deep penetration\n",
