    "**Note:** The top two cells are both showing the purchase history of customers. But one is using `INNER JOIN` and the other is using `LEFT JOIN`. So what's the difference? If you pay close attention you will see that the two tables don't have the same number of rows. The main difference between the two is that `LEFT JOIN` conserves all the entries on the left (customers) and if it can't find any purchases for that customer it will return `NULL`. However, `INNER JOIN` tries to find a match. If a customer doesn't have any purchases in the list it will not be shown in th final result.<br>\n",
    "`INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` are the most common types of join. However, there are other types such as `CROSS JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, etc. You can find more information about these types of join on https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/.\n"
