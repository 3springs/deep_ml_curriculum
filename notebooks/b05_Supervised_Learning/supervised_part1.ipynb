    "This is a well dataset of Well's Petroleum wells drilled on the Norwegian continental shelf. It was released by the Norweigen Government, cleaned by Geolink, and loaded by LukasMosser. The full dataset has 221 wells, over 150 lithologies, with around 500 MB of data.\n",

    "- LITHOLOGY_GEOLINK - This is the facies or lithology, which means rock type. This is a label, made by multiple human experts by looking at the context, the well, maps of the area, and often picture of rock samples extracted from the well.\n",

    "    - GR - [Gamma Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray_logging): Measure passive amount of high energy electromagnetic radiation naturally emitted from the rock\n",
    "    - RHOB - [Bulk Density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_logging): Measured active amount high energy electromagnetic radiation. This has a transmitting source of gamma rays\n",
    "    - DTC - [Compressional wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_wave) travel time: This measure the how long a compressional wave takes to travel through the formationation\n",

Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Vapnik et al., 1997), it presents one of the most robust prediction methods, based on the statistical learning framework.\n",

    "- One vs. the rest. For 𝑘 classes, 𝑘 binary classifiers are trained. Each determines whether an example belongs to its 'own' class versus any other class. The classifier with the largest output is taken to be the class of the example.\n",
