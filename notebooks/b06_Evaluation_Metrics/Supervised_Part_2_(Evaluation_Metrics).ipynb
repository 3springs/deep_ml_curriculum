    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning (ML), evaluating the trained models is one of the most important tasks in the model creation cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical workflow for supervised learning looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Select a model with an initial configuration, train the model and then predict on unseen data (Test Dataset a.k.a `X_test` and `y_test`).\n",
    "- 2. Compare the target `y_test` with the results from `y_predicted`. Then measure the performance using an evaluation metrics.\n",
    "- 3. The hyperparameters of the models are finetuned to reach the optimal for the evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Important to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluating a model is an important step to build effective ML models.\n",
    "- There are many different evaluation metrics with some pros and cons. Some popular metrics are `Accuracy`, `Confusion Matrix`, `AUC and ROC Curves`, and `Mean Squared Error`. \n",
    "- Depending on the ML task, there are different metrics for different ML tasks. For example, `Mean Squared Error` is usually used for regression problems, whereas the `Confusion Matrix` for classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, we can perform `classification` and `regression` tasks. In a nutshell, the tasks of `classification` correspond to the task of assigning classes or labels to the sampled data. For example, the problem of classifying images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9 will have 10 classes. On the other hand, regression tries to predict continuous values. For example, predicting the price of a house given the neighbourhood, number of rooms, etc. (Example: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques))\n",

    "To evaluate the performance on regression problems, we will use metrics that measure the distance between the target values and the predictions made by our model. It is common to hear that a regression metric is called `loss` or `error` functions. Depending on the context, some loss functions are referred to with different names. For example, Mean Absolute Error is often called `L1 loss` or `Manhattan distance` in academic papers.\n",

    "Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics))\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cross-validation, sometimes called rotation estimation or out-of-sample testing, is any of various similar model validation techniques for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice. In a prediction problem, a model is usually given a dataset of known data on which training is run (training dataset), and a dataset of unknown data (or first seen data) against which the model is tested (called the validation dataset or testing set). The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias and to give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset (i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "> One round of cross-validation involves partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset (called the training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the validation set or testing set). To reduce variability, in most methods multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions, and the validation results are combined (e.g. averaged) over the rounds to give an estimate of the model's predictive performance.\n",
    "In summary, cross-validation combines (averages) measures of fitness in prediction to derive a more accurate estimate of model prediction performance\n",

    "In this session, we will learn about the cross-validation, also called 'k-fold cross-validation' method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We already used `train_test_split` to split the data, so we can measure the quality of a model on the test data. Cross-validation extends this approach. Compared to `train_test_split`, cross-validation gives you a more reliable measure of a model's quality, however, it takes longer to run.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Shortcoming of Train-Test Split:** <br/>\n",
    "Imagine you have a dataset with 5000 rows. The `train_test_split` function has an argument for test_size that you can use to decide how many rows go to the training set and how many go to the test set. The larger the test set, the more reliable your measures of model quality will be. At an extreme, you could imagine having only 1 row of data in the test set. If you compare alternative models, which one makes the best predictions on a single data point will be mostly a matter of luck.\n",
    "You will typically keep about 20% as a test dataset. But even with 1000 rows in the test set, there's some random chance in determining model scores. A model might do well on one set of 1000 rows, even if it would be inaccurate on a different 1000 rows. The larger the test set, the less randomness (aka \"noise\") there is in our measure of model quality.\n",
    "But we can only get a large test set by removing data from our training data, and smaller training datasets mean worse models. In fact, the ideal modelling decisions on a small dataset typically aren't the best modelling decisions on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Trade-offs Between Cross-Validation and Train-Test Split** <br/>\n",
    "Cross-validation gives a more accurate measure of model quality, which is especially important if you are making a lot of modeling decisions. However, it can take more time to run, because it estimates models once for each fold. So it is doing more total work.\n",
    "Given these tradeoffs, when should you use each approach? On small datasets, the extra computational burden of running cross-validation isn't a big deal. These are also the problems where model quality scores would be least reliable with train-test split. So, if your dataset is smaller, you should run cross-validation.\n",
    "For the same reasons, a simple train-test split is sufficient for larger datasets. It will run faster, and you may have enough data that there's little need to re-use some of it for holdout.\n",
    "There's no simple threshold for what constitutes a large vs small dataset. If your model takes a couple minute or less to run, it's probably worth switching to cross-validation. If your model takes much longer to run, cross-validation may slow down your workflow more than it's worth.\n",
    "Alternatively, you can run cross-validation and see if the scores for each experiment seem close. If each experiment gives the same results, train-test split is probably sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "K-fold procedure can be described in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shuffle the dataset randomly.\n",
    "2. Split the dataset into k groups\n",
    "3. For each unique group:\n",
    "    - Take the group as a hold out or test data set\n",
    "    - Take the remaining groups as a training data set\n",
    "    - Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set\n",
    "    - Retain the evaluation score and discard the model\n",
    "4. Summarise the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores"
