    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is the machine learning (ML) task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs [3]. It infers a function from labelled training data consisting of a set of training examples [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example below, where we have a classification problem. The MNIST dataset uses images corresponding to handwritten digits from 0 to 9 for a total of 10 different classes. Suppose that we already have a trained model. \n",
    "\n",
    "![ML](ml2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the image represents the digit 1 which is passed to the Machine Learning classifier, then the output generates an array with 10 positions (every position represents a class), being the class 0 and 9, the first and last position of the array. So we can define the ML classifier as a function that is going to map the input (in our case an image of the digit 1), to a set of probabilities (values ranging from 0 to 1) for the 10 different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, $p(1|x, \\theta)$ = 0.84. In ML is common to use the <code>argmax()</code> function to get the position of the array with the maximum probability. This index would correspond to the most likely label. If we apply <code>argmax()</code> to the output array, we will get the value 1 in return given that 0.84 is the maximum probability value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an ML algorithm, we have to modify the internal learnable parameters $\\theta$. Those values will allow the algorithm to map correctly its input to the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the supervised learning approach, we need to provide many examples of inputs with their correspondent label or class to the algorithm for the training phase. In the image below, we can observe a representation of this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ML](ml1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this iterative process, a loss or cost function is used to measure the distance between the real label and the prediction. The aim of the training process is then to get a closer distance between the prediction and real label on unseen images. \n",

    "> Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labelled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization allows for modelling of probability densities over inputs.[1] It forms one of the three main categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning. Semi-supervised learning, a related variant, makes use of supervised and unsupervised techniques. \n",

    "## One Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, imagine that you have an output sequence of the following 3 labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"bronze\"\n",
    "- \"silver\"\n",
    "- \"gold\"\n",
    "\n",

    "- \"silver\" -> 2\n",
    "- \"gold\"   -> 3\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding uses binary vectors instead to represent the labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example below shows an intuitive one-hot representation for the labels where `1` represents the presence of the label and `0` the abscence of it.\n",

    "- \"silver\" -> [0,1,0]\n",
    "- \"gold\"   -> [0,0,1]\n",

Normalise the data will almost always improve the results for ML algorithms.\n",
