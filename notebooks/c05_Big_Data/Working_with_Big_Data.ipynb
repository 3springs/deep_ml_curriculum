    "There are many occasions when we have to work with datasets that are so big we can't just load all of it into memory. If we have to work with such a data, what is the solution? One of the libraries in python for this type of problems is __Dask__. Dask is a library for parallel computing. It helps us perform common pandas and numpy opperations on large datasets. In this tutorial we will learn about some of the features of Dask and how it can help us."

    "\n",
    "Numba is a **just-in-time**, **type-specializing**, **function compiler** for accelerating **numerically-focused** Python.  That's a long list, so let's break down those terms:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **function compiler**: Numba compiles Python functions, not entire applications, and not parts of functions.  Numba does not replace your Python interpreter, but is just another Python module that can turn a function into a (usually) faster function. \n",
    " * **type-specializing**: Numba speeds up your function by generating a specialized implementation for the specific data types you are using.  Python functions are designed to operate on generic data types, which makes them very flexible, but also very slow.  In practice, you only will call a function with a small number of argument types, so Numba will generate a fast implementation for each set of types.\n",
    " * **just-in-time**: Numba translates functions when they are first called.  This ensures the compiler knows what argument types you will be using.  This also allows Numba to be used interactively in a Jupyter notebook just as easily as a traditional application\n",
    " * **numerically-focused**: Currently, Numba is focused on numerical data types, like `int`, `float`, and `complex`.  There is very limited string processing support, and many string use cases are not going to work well on the GPU.  To get best results with Numba, you will likely be using NumPy arrays.\n"
