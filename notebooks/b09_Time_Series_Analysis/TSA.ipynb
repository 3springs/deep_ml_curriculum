    "# Time Series Anaysis\n",

    "An important part of time series analysis (TSA) is time series forcasting (TSF) which is using a sequence of data to predict future behaviour. In this session we will discuss TSA, and tool and technques in TSA. The next session will be focused on forcasting.\n",

This is helpful when we want to get rid of noise in the data so we can have a better look at the trends. However, noise reduction comes at a cost. The downside of using moving average is the it creates lag in the data. For instance if there is a sudden increase in the data moving average responds to this change slower.
