    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks (ANNs), usually simply called neural networks (NNs), are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. The \"signal\" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we can observe a neural network with 3 inputs and 2 outputs. The layers in the middle are called hidden layers. The term 'Deep' from Deep Learning is given for the number of hidden layers in a neural net.\n",

    "## 1.1 Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> In machine learning, backpropagation, is a widely used algorithm in training feedforward neural networks for supervised learning. Generalizations of backpropagation exist for other artificial neural networks (ANNs)... In fitting a neural network, backpropagation computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input–output example, and does so efficiently, unlike a naive direct computation of the gradient with respect to each weight individually. This efficiency makes it feasible to use gradient methods for training multilayer networks, updating weights to minimize loss; gradient descent, or variants such as stochastic gradient descent, are commonly used. <b>\n",
    "The backpropagation algorithm works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule.<b/>\n",

    "**Optimizers:** are algorithms that updates the neural network parameters such as the weights to reduce the losses. Popular optimizers are : \n",
    "    \n",
    "- `Gradient Descent`: Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, we take steps proportional to the negative of the gradient of the function at the current point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Stochastic Gradient Descent`: Stochastic gradient descent is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties. It can be regarded as a stochastic approximation of gradient descent optimization, since it replaces the actual gradient by an estimate thereof.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `Adam`: an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments.\n",
    "Source: [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The methods mentioned before are iterative processes that take steps to advance towards a solution. The step size at each iteration towards the minimum of loss is the **learning rate**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Activation Functions:** Activation functions are important to add non-linearity into the models. This will allow the model to represent more complex data.\n",
