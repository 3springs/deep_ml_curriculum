    "# Region based CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "Region-based convolutional neural networks or regions with CNN features (R-CNNs) are a pioneering approach that applies deep models to object detection. R-CNN models first select several proposed regions from an image and then they use a CNN to perform forward computation to extract features from each proposed area. Afterwards, we use the features of each proposed region to predict their categories and bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, R-CNNs are composed of four main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selective search is performed on the input image to select multiple high-quality proposed regions. These proposed regions are generally selected on multiple scales and have different shapes and sizes. The category and ground-truth bounding box of each proposed region is labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A pre-trained CNN is selected and placed, in truncated form, before the output layer. It transforms each proposed region into the input dimensions required by the network and uses forward computation to output the features extracted from the proposed regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The features and labeled category of each proposed region are combined as an example to train multiple support vector machines for object classification. Here, each support vector machine is used to determine whether an example belongs to a certain category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The features and labeled bounding box of each proposed region are combined as an example to train a linear regression model for ground-truth bounding box prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although R-CNN models use pre-trained CNNs to effectively extract image features, the main downside is the slow speed. As you can imagine, we can select thousands of proposed regions from a single image, requiring thousands of forward computations from the CNN to perform object detection. This massive computing load means that R-CNNs are not widely used in actual applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: [R-CNNs](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/rcnn.html)\n",
    "\n",
    " In this section, we will discuss R-CNNs and a series of improvements made to them: [Fast R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.08083.pdf), [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf), and [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870.pdf).

    "If training data is labeled with the pixel-level positions of each object in an image, a Mask R-CNN model can effectively use these detailed labels to further improve the precision of object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mask R-CNN is a modification to the Faster R-CNN model. Mask R-CNN models replace the RoI pooling layer with an RoI alignment layer. This allows the use of bilinear interpolation to retain spatial information on feature maps, making Mask R-CNN better suited for pixel-level predictions. The RoI alignment layer outputs feature maps of the same shape for all RoIs. This not only predicts the categories and bounding boxes of RoIs, but allows us to use an additional fully convolutional network to predict the pixel-level positions of objects. We will describe how to use fully convolutional networks to predict pixel-level semantics in images later in this chapter.\n",
